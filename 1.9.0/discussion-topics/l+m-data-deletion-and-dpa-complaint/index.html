<p><a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/discussions/480">GitHub discussion</a></p>
<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="11-discussion-paper-topic-description">1.1 Discussion Paper topic description</h3>
<p>The present discussion paper discusses how a wallet user can use her wallet unit to request the erasure 
of personal data at a wallet-relying party and for lodging a complaint with the competent data protection supervisory 
authority. </p>
<p>The present paper builds upon (see <a href="#3-existing-high-level-requirements">clause 3</a>) and complements (see <a href="#61-high-level-requirements-to-be-added-to-annex-2">clause 6</a>) the related discussion in <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/annexes/annex-2/annex-2-high-level-requirements.md#a2348-topic-48---blueprint-for-requesting-data-deletion-to-relying-parties"><strong>Topic 48</strong> (Blueprint for requesting data deletion to Relying Parties)</a>

<p>Risks considered in <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/discussion-topics/a-privacy-risks-and-mitigations.md">Topic_A</a> are also applicable here and additional risks
may be added in this discussion paper, if this turns out to be necessary.</p>
<h3 id="13-key-words">1.3 Key words</h3>
<p>This document uses the capitalised key words 'SHALL', 'SHOULD' and 'MAY' as
specified in <a href="http://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.html">RFC 2119</a>, i.e., to indicate requirements, recommendations and
options specified in this document.</p>
<p>In addition, 'must' (non-capitalised) is used to indicate an external
constraint, for instance a self-evident necessity or a requirement that is
mandated by an external document. The word 'can' indicates a capability, whereas
other words, such as 'will' and 'is' or 'are' are intended as statements of
fact.</p>
<h3 id="14-relevant-definitions-and-requirements-from-the-general-data-protection-regulation-eu-2016679">1.4 Relevant definitions and requirements from the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679</h3>
<p>Article 2 (4) of <a href="http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj">(EU) No 910/2014</a> 
stipulates that this regulation is without prejudice to the ''General Data Protection Regulation'' (GDPR)
<a href="http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj">(EU) 2016/679</a> and hence it seems to be 
appropriate to recall the most relevant stipulations from GDPR here. </p>
<h4 id="141-definitions">1.4.1 Definitions</h4>
<p>Article 4 of <a href="http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj">(EU) 2016/679</a> in particular contains the
following definitions: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) ‘<strong>personal data</strong>’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;</p>
<p>(2) ‘<strong>processing</strong>’ means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;</p>
<p>(3) ‘<strong>restriction of processing</strong>’ means the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future;</p>
<p>(5) ‘<strong>pseudonymisation</strong>’ means the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person;</p>
<p>(6) ‘<strong>filing system</strong>’ means any structured set of personal data which are accessible according to specific criteria, whether centralised, decentralised or dispersed on a functional or geographical basis;</p>
<p>(7) ‘<strong>controller</strong>’ means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law;</p>
<p>(8) ‘<strong>processor</strong>’ means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller;</p>
<p>(9) ‘<strong>recipient</strong>’ means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing;</p>
<p>(10) ‘<strong>third party</strong>’ means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data;</p>
<p>(11) ‘<strong>consent</strong>’ of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her;</p>
<p>(12) ‘<strong>personal data breach</strong>’ means a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed;</p>
<p>(21) ‘<strong>supervisory authority</strong>’ means an independent public authority which is established by a Member State pursuant to Article 51;</p>
<p>(22) '<strong>supervisory authority concerned</strong>’ means a supervisory authority which is concerned by the processing of personal data because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) the controller or processor is established on the territory of the Member State of that supervisory authority;</p>
<p>(b) data subjects residing in the Member State of that supervisory authority are substantially affected or likely to be substantially affected by the processing; or</p>
<p>(c) a complaint has been lodged with that supervisory authority;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="142-requirements">1.4.2 Requirements</h4>
<h5 id="article-5-principles-relating-to-processing-of-personal-data">Article 5 (Principles relating to processing of personal data)</h5>
<p>Article 5 Nr. 1 of <a href="http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj">(EU) 2016/679</a> requires that personal data 
shall be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (‘<strong>lawfulness, fairness and transparency</strong>’);</p>
<p>(b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes (‘<strong>purpose limitation</strong>’);</p>
<p>(c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (‘<strong>data minimisation</strong>’);</p>
<p>(d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay (‘<strong>accuracy</strong>’);</p>
